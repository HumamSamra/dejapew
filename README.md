# Deja-Pew!

A fast-paced memory card game built with Flutter.
Flip, match, and outsmart your opponent in this modern twist on the classic “Memory” game. Featuring smooth animations, sound effects, and even a bot opponent — all wrapped in a clean Flutter experience.

Simple, fun, and perfect to play with friends or solo! 🎮

# 🌟 Inspiration

The name Deja-Pew is inspired by the classic card-matching game we used to play as kids — where players rely on memory to collect as many pairs as possible.
We mashed that nostalgic concept with an energetic arcade twist:

Déjà vu → the memory aspect 🧠

Pew! → speed, fun, and a touch of sci-fi ⚡

Together, they capture the feeling of quickly zapping matching pairs with precision and style.
